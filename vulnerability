Hı Im a Vulnerability Researcher and bone fide hacker.I found some vuln. in overthewire.org website and ı wanna share with u lets go first
1) we can attain the website ssh with 'ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 ' code it's a first step for us so when we ls or ls -la we can see 
txt file and u know we can reach that wit 'cat' parametres that's all.
2)İn the second level we cannot read file because its a parametres in shell so we have to use './-' code and thats all with this code we can reach a file 
anf get password basicly.
3)The third one we have spaces file thats a ı hate when ı meet okay its hard but we can use 'cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename' for this lecture its a goood 
tool for us when we needed
4)4. case we have so much file and we have to use 'find' parameteres or find one of one it doesnt matter we can use ls -la and find a maybere07 and get 
password its a imoprtant thing for us ls -la cauze its give us allthing 
5)İts too hard because we have 1000+ file in this case we have to use some parameters in 'find' first u have to fing --help and reeach the documnetation
first so we got it its basic just 'find / -type -f user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c so its give us so much result but all one are permission needed
but the one column not have that its a password what we have to find its in the 'cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password' on your computer.
6)when we get strings or cat data.txt its has a million result so we cannot find manually that the solutions we have to use strings and gres parameters
go strings data.txt | grep "milliont" its give us a password
7)this lecture we have to use 'sort' parameters beacause so much result and we cannot find just 'sort data.txt | grep somethinng else its like a permissions
moderate level for us maybe we have to go wikipedia and search something about this
8)They told us password is secret in '=' parameteres but we know to use grep and just go and 'strings data.txt | grep "=" maybe we can see password immediatly
but I think its not easy like that just try the other file and find
9)its just a base64 vulnearability its too easy for who know ASSEMBLY if u dont know ASSEMBLY its hard for u even impossible whit this way just go base64
-d data.txt and find password
10)Yes, slowly slowly its beeing hard its a ENCRPYTED DECODER vulnerability u have to know BURPSUİTE so good and fast because its not a basic password when 
we go ls -la or some cat parameteres for read file but its give use a so hard ENCRYPTED like a 'Gur cnffjbeq vf WIAOOSFzMjXXBC0KoSKBbJ8puQm5lIEi' its too
hard without BURPSUİTE go BURPSUİTE decoder column and some search for this encrpyted and when u find real parameteres try to password if it not detected
u have to know BURPSUİTE lessons.
11)Oww.. its a discusting took a time like  1 2 day TERRİBLE.  u have to know TAR,GZİP,BZ2,TAR XF,LOCALHOST DOMANİN and find password its too long maybe I 
download a video for you.
12)GREAT its a best and funniest vuln. ı ever seen because we use 'SSH,-i,sshkey.privatekey,port scan,nmap scan and ENCRYPTED DECODER.' I wanna to explain 
so much ssh means are go shell terminal and the -i give us all panel without password we have to use. sshkey.privatekey is a hard one because u have to find
in admin panel dont worry its a same with bandit12@bandit.org u can use nc for port scan and nmap -p- scan for scan everything in the last one u have tu
find  'ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost -p2220 fGrHPx402xGC7U7rXKDaxiWFTOiF0ENq' for password
13) İts basic for who know send scan shell because we just send a result for the other level its have to use ncat just keeping ncat --help and read documen-
tation and 'ncat --ssl localhost 30001 JQttfApK4SeyHwDlI9SXGR50qclOAil1' for find password
14)ncat --ssl localhost 31790 -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

thats al  for the 14. scan its give us a some result and lets go the solutions 
first of all we have tı change port with chmod parameters 'chmod 400 privatekey17.txt' and 'ssh -i privatekey17.txt bandit17@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220'
for go panel wanna see PASSWORD its in a 'cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit17'

THANKS FOR READ!
